# I-am-Encryption

Colloection of three encryption algorithms, namely
- SHA1 hash algorithm
- RSA encryption algorithm
- AES encryption algorithm

All three algorithms have been implemeted fully in python. The first two has been implemented purely from scratch, while the AES algorithm uses functions and modules from the pyCrypto library.

## Directions for Setting up Environment-

To run the programs, pre-requisites include-

- Python 3 and above
- Dependencies from the requirements.txt

Using a virtual environment is advised in order to avoid path clashes.

To install the python dependencies from requirements.txt:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
